Last year, my wife and I joined a group of people that casually played volleyball weekly. It's been 8 months or so.
We made new friends and met adorable people. The more we played, the more we wanted to invest in learning the sport properly.

For 2024, my goal was to join a team and train with a coach. I'm happy to report it's been almost 2 months that I did so.
It is such a different ball game: technique, speed and height of the net. So many things to learn.

One of the many topics this new volleyball world made me realize is: never underestimate how hard it can be to be the most rookie in the room.
The group and the coach are very welcoming, despite my lack of knowledge in so many areas. Even in such an environment, I had moments where I second guessed my decision:
- attacking in an official net requires a smooth technique for someone of my height
- defending and reacting to powerful hits really is something else

In the back of my mind, I tried to remind myself that it takes time and persistence to develop skills. I could feel me putting pressure on myself to evolve and being frustrated by not reaching my own expectations, whatever that means.
Some weeks ago, we played 3 official games. Despite the results, I was, at the most part, enjoying myself in court and appreciating the fact of just playing.

I have no idea what the future holds, but I can say I'm satisfied of this decision.

Ellen, thanks for connecting me with them. You were key for all of this.

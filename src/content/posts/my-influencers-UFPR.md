I'm sorry, I can't go straight to the agenda today before an honest disclosure to myself: there's a part of me that feels ashaimed about how long I took to simply acknowledge this fact. I know some are more self-conscious than others, but still.. I'm counting on it to be a process so I can accept it better as time goes by. Enough of venting.

I'm writing this near Christmas so this is an homage to all my UFPR colleagues that influenced who am I today. You can't spend ~5 years with a group of people and remain unchanged, that's simply naive. This text is about some areas that I recognize the influence and, as you can tell by the intro, there's probably a thousand others areas I'm missing. 

Lastly, I don't like that generic "I won't name any people becaue I'd risk forgetting some", so I'll definitely name a few. I encourage you to do the same. I'd be happy to read about it too, I'm genuinely curious on how you tell this story.

## Context
UFPR is the university where I studied Embedded Systems. Classess were always at night (18h50 ~ 22h30). As a result, it lasts 6 years. It was built like this to fit the need of those who needed to work during the day.

I was not sure at all when choosing it. Much less of the impact of joining a group of people that were alreay doing their 9-to-5. I moved from the coast to the capital. My goal was study. That's it. I'd share an appartment with 2 other colleagues up until I graduate.

## The beginning
My early rountine would be to go to university close to the start of the class then go back home. During the day, I'd probably play something online, review some of what we saw in class and that was it. That was similar to how High School looked like.

The more I got to know my colleagues, the more I realized how their routines were different. In hindsight, I'd say the vast majority did not have this luxury. 

### Jean
He was probably the first I one I talked to. I'm glad we are friends until today. I remember the moment I was introduced to the definition of the verb *se d√©brouiller* when studying French, I could not think of anyone else other than him. It's my mental alias.

He was always running errands to complement his income, be it related or unrelated to engineering. If *Getting Things Done* had to be personified in a person, that's him.

As such, he was very practical and intuitive while I tend to be slower and more careful. I guess these traits also played a role on how well the partnership would be for the years ahead.


### Rafael, Sena and Elton
This was my Holy Trinity. It goes without saying, but they were all hardworkers. They seemed to know each other beforehand and my memories are of a light environment, where they would always be joking at each other.

We'd laugh together gambling at which point in time would Rafael sleep. The light environment was hiding the real meaning of the hardwork I alluded to earlier: those people would wake up at 6 a.m. or earlier, do their 9-to-5 and come straight to university, often with 2-3 hours of commute per day. They were true heroes.

Sometime ago I wrote about [how living in France changed my life](/blog/living-in-france-changed-my-life). Today, I want to dive in one aspect of this change: creativity. As I alluded to in that text, if I had to describe myself back then, I'd say "someone very rational, logical based". Early 2017, however, I enrolled into a "Re-learning creativity" course, created and presented by the one and only [Murilo Gun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/murilogun)

It might be obvious by now, but I thought you were either naturally talented to be creative or you simply were not mean to be. Musicians, artists, actors, writers, poets are some of the examples that usually come to mind. More than anything, I was curious to find tricks and techniques that an average person (me) could apply to gain some creativity points.

The TLDR version of the story is that the "re-learning" come from the fact we were all born being capable of imagining. A rather simple definition of creativity is: apply your imagination to solve real world problems. In this case, the journey is to find our inner child and unleashing its full potential.

Like anyone who carefully observes a child growing up, I found that argument so compelling. Try it out: pretend to be a character from a movie a close kid of yours enjoy. That is *all* that is necessary for the whole environment to change. There is no need to do any extra preparation. I was picturing this scene and thinking to myself: is it possible for us, adults, to engage with a similar level of detachment from reality? Without worrying about looking like a fool or leaving our biases behind?

I took the course and I can't recommend it enough (is currently free - [check it out here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz2K439mADg&list=PLMtKfZwPN_B35-S6JEV4nq2JKw1fTtEU6) if you're a Portuguese speaker). I still don't consider myself creative (it feels such a deep assertion, doesn't it?). Nonetheless, I felt it served its purpose to open a new way of looking to the world. I guess it also teaches you to have a low ego and how being curious can make you so far.
At some point during the course, the video below is presented. It immediately brought tears to me eyes. I can't recall an ad that had the same impact on me ever since. This is one of the "bedside videos" I have around to take me back to that atmosphere again. It also made me aware of Supertramp ([check out the full song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=low6Coqrw9Y), it's a masterpiece!)

Murilo Gun has a deep influence ever since. He's been in an impressive journey to getting to know yourself and listening to your inner voice. Give him a chance if you're interested in that field too, you won't be disappointed

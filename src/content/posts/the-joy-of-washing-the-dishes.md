I started dating my wife 15 years ago. Back then, out of the many things that caught my attention when joining the environment of a new family, there was one that intrigued me for many years: the joy when washing the dishes.

At home, my siblings and I would do **any kind** of business to simply get away of this task. I remember even the impact of thinking about it during a meal that I had to do such a task. I was 14, my sister, 11, and my brother, 9.

At my wife's home, they volunteered themselves to do it. I couldn't be more surprise, I vividly remember thinking: "how on Earth can someone do that? These people are definitely weird." This was just a small sign on how the culture was different.

After some months, I started volunteered myself, believe it or not. The craziest part: I did not feel any pressure to do that, it was just natural in that environment to do so. The same task that I would fight in my place, I was doing with no pressure somewhere else. I tried to rationalize at that time with no success, I quickly let it go and did not come up with any reasonable conclusion.

Now, I would say that culture of a place indeed plays a key role on how people behave. That's something that Simon Sinek says all the time too. We are thinking of having kids and that's one of the topics on my radar: which environment will we create for this new human being?

15 years ago, I was in the receiving end of how impactful it can be and, nowadays, I can provide a tiny bit of this same feeling to others in our work place. I've been onboarding new people on our team for the last 2 years and I felt the impact of newcomers noticing how we genuily care to welcome new ones and how we strive to create a culture that can make everyone flourish. Life is good.

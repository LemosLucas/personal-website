The reason I decided to write in this blog and not anywhere else is: ownership. At first, I considered using other platforms so I didn't have to worry about maintaing a site, a domain, a server and all other pieces of infrastructure that are needed. I won't deny, there is indeed a cost in pursuing this path. I don't want to judge you in case you opted to a more convenient solution, but rather show some benefits that might not be that obvious.

I can have nearly full control of the User Experience (usually limited my lack of skills only). What does it mean in practice?
- I won't collect any of your data
- I won't auto-play an ad as you scroll my posts
- I won't insert any banners in the middle of the paragraphs
- I won't send you cookies. As a consequence, no cookie banners to avoid or reject

I understand I have a luxury that other services don't have. I don't plan selling you any product. As a consequence, this blog is more the old school way of having blogs.
I don't collect statistics to show me the views, a like button or a space for comments. That's by design.

I want to have a place where I can write about anything that comes to mind. It's a surprising pleasure I discovered lately. There is no ambitious plan beyond this.

If you, dear reader, want to keep yourself posted about what I write, I set up a RSS feed on [https://lemosl.com.br/rss.xml](https://lemosl.com.br/rss.xml). If that's new to you, I encourage you to spend 5 minutes looking into it. This can help you find other writers like me.

I'm also open to hear from you, I enjoy human interactions. Although I understand if you think it does not seem like that, I have a feeling that adhering to the principles outlined above will increase my chances of meaningful conversations with those that shared these values too.

I'm available at [me@lemosl.com.br](mailto:me@lemosl.com.br).
